    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h5><em>Monster Extract</em></h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients in a blender. Transfer to an airtight container through a mesh 
            strainer. Store in the refrigerator until you are going to use it. This extract 
            will be fresh in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5><em>Soup</em></h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 400Â°F. Take each of the sweet potatoes and stab them several times with 
            a fork. Wrap each of the sweet potatoes in aluminum foil and then place on a baking sheet. 
            Roast the sweet potatoes for 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>At about 40 minutes of the potatoes roasting, add the cauliflower to the baking sheet and 
            allow to roast for the remaining 20 minutes. Once the time has passed, set the cauliflower 
            to the side. Check if the sweet potatoes are done by piercing one with a knife. If it 
            inserts easily, it is ready. Otherwise, roast until it is soft enough.</li>
        <li>Heat a pot over medium heat and coat with canola oil. Add the fennel bulb, onion, red 
            onion, and garlic and cook until they are soft, about 8 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle the 
            softened vegetables with the thyme and sage. Add the roasted vegetables and vegetable broth 
            and bring to a slight boil. Lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and transfer the contents in the pot into a blender and blend until smooth. 
            Return to the pot and turn on the heat to low. Add the monster extract and lime juice. Heat 
            until the soup has warmed all the way through. Season with salt and pepper to your liking. 
            Serve in a bowl topped with the garnishes.</li>
    </ol>
